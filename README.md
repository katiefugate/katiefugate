## <p align='center'>About Me</p>

Hi there! My name is Katie, and I am a Software Developer 👩‍💻 with a background as a registered behavior technician. I recently made the decision to switch to tech and attended LearningFuze Web Development Bootcamp, where I gained valuable knowledge and skills in web development.

With one year of experience at BeSmartee, I have been able to put my newfound skills to use to build web applications to help clients achieve their business goals.

My background as a registered behavior technician has given me a unique perspective on problem-solving and communication. I have found that the skills I developed in my previous career have translated well into my new field. I have a strong attention to detail, an organized approach to problem-solving 🧩, and excellent communication skills.

I am passionate about software development and am always looking to learn and grow in my role 📚. I am excited to explore new technologies and take on new challenges that will help me continue to develop my skills and expertise.
